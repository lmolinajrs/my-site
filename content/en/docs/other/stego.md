### stegsolve
```
# Sometimes there is a message or a text hidden in the image itself and in order to view it you need to apply some color filters or play with the color levels. You can do it with GIMP or Photoshop or any other image editing software but stegsolve made it easier. itâ€™s a small java tool that applies many color filters on images.
```
### strings
```
# Strings is a linux tool that displays printable strings in a file. That simple tool can be very helpful when solving stego challenges. Usually the embedded data is password protected or encrypted and sometimes the password is actaully in the file itself and can be easily viewed by using strings

# Supports these file formats:

All

strings <file>  (displays printable strings in the given file)
```
### exiftool
```
# Sometimes important stuff is hidden in the metadata of the image or the file , exiftool can be very helpful to view the metadata of the files.

# Supports these file formats:

Many

exiftool <file>  (shows the metadata of the given file)
```
### exiv2
```
# A tool similar to exiftool.

# Supports these file formats:

Many

exiv2 <file>  (shows the metadata of the given file)
```
### binwalk
```
# Binwalk is a tool for searching binary files like images and audio files for embedded files and data.

# Supports these file formats:

Many

binwalk <file>  (Displays the embedded data in the given file)
binwalk -e <file>  (Displays and extracts the data from the given file)
```
### zsteg
